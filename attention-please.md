This bot sanitizes Nicknames so you can rest in peace.

## Setup
In order to add !AttentioPlease to your server, simply follow these three simple steps:
###  Testing
Test if !AttentionPlease meets your expectations on a Test Server or the given [Support Server](https://discord.gg/9rx5vG4). There is no easy way to undo the nick changes performed, so don't skip this.

### Invite
Invite !AttentionPlease using the invite at the top. **After you invited !AttenionPlease, it will *immediately* start to rename users without roles.**

### Moving the role
Move the Bot Role above the highest role you want to have names changed for. If you want *every* member to be affected, you must move it above the highest role. If Moderators should not be affected, move it below your Moderator Role. Giving a bot role with the desired position is also effective. The owner will never be effected. These are Discord Limitations.
